automata machine problems
MP1 is \src\automata\MP1.java 
  MP1.in input file
  MP1.out output file
MP2 is using simulation solution is \src\automata\MP2Simulation.java
  implemented using the rules of the problem
MP2 is using dfa tables solution is \src\automata\MP2SelfBuidingDFA.java 
  implemented using an empty dfa table filled up according the rules of the problem.
  For every test case if it reads an un defined transition function it creates a corresponding row in the dfa table. 
  If the transition function is defined it follows the function.
